# FMOS LoadAvgCheck Manager

A utility script for FireMon OS (FMOS) that automatically manages the LoadAvgCheck health check during backup operations to prevent false alerts caused by high system load during backups.

## Overview

During FMOS backup operations, system load can spike significantly, triggering the LoadAvgCheck health monitor and generating unnecessary alerts. This script automatically disables the LoadAvgCheck before backups begin and re-enables it after completion, ensuring clean backup operations without false positive health alerts.

## Version Comparison

This project provides **two versions** of the script:

### üêç Python Version
**File:** `manage_loadavg_check.py`

**Advantages:**
- ‚úÖ **FireMon OS native** - Automatically detects and uses FMOS pre-installed Python libraries
- ‚úÖ **Better error handling** - More informative error messages with detailed diagnostics
- ‚úÖ **Native JSON support** - No external dependencies like `jq`
- ‚úÖ **Cleaner code** - Object-oriented design, easier to maintain and extend
- ‚úÖ **Built-in HTTP client** - Uses `requests` library

**Considerations:**
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Python version dependent** - Requires `python3.12` on current FMOS versions (may change with OS updates)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Must verify Python library paths match installed version

**Requirements:** Python 3.6+ (standard on FMOS) - `requests` module auto-detected on FireMon OS

### üêö Bash Version
**File:** `manage_loadavg_check.sh`

**Advantages:**
- ‚úÖ **No version dependencies** - Bash doesn't change versions like Python does
- ‚úÖ **More stable long-term** - Not affected by Python version updates
- ‚úÖ **Familiar syntax** - Standard bash/shell scripting
- ‚úÖ **Simpler execution** - Just `bash script.sh`, no version-specific interpreter

**Requirements:**
- `jq` for JSON processing (standard on FMOS)
- `curl` for API calls (standard on FMOS)

**Both versions work equally well on FireMon OS when installed to `/var/lib/backup/firemon/` to avoid SELinux issues.**

### Which Version Should You Use?

**Choose Python if:**
- You prefer modern error handling and diagnostics
- You want native JSON manipulation without external tools
- You don't mind specifying `python3.12` (or updating commands if Python version changes)

**Choose Bash if:**
- You want long-term stability without version dependencies
- You prefer traditional shell scripting
- You want to avoid potential Python version conflicts during FMOS upgrades

**Both versions have identical functionality and work reliably on FireMon OS.**

## Features

- **Automatic Check Management**: Disables LoadAvgCheck before backups, re-enables after completion
- **Load Settling Delay**: Waits 15 minutes after backup before re-enabling to prevent false alerts (can be bypassed with `--no-wait`)
- **API-Based Configuration**: Uses FMOS Control Panel API via curl (no CLI permission issues!)
- **Secure Credential Storage**: Prompts for credentials during setup, stores them securely with 644 permissions
- **Simple Architecture**: Script runs directly from wherever you place it - no complexity!
- **Smart Cronjob Sync**: Automatically detects backup schedule changes and updates cronjob timing
- **Post-Backup Hooks**: Configures FMOS post-backup scripts for automatic re-enable
- **Flexible Logging**: Optional logging with control over verbosity
- **Status Monitoring**: View current configuration and check status with schedule validation
- **Safe Configuration**: Uses `jq` for safe JSON manipulation without overwriting other settings
- **Immediate Updates**: Changes to the script take effect immediately

## Requirements

### Python Version (Recommended)
- FMOS virtual appliance with admin user access
- Python 3.6 or higher (standard on FMOS)
- Python `requests` module (pre-installed on FMOS, auto-detected by script)
- FMOS Control Panel API credentials
- No root/sudo access required
- **Note:** Script automatically detects and uses FireMon's pre-installed Python libraries at `/usr/lib/firemon/devpackfw/lib/python3.*/site-packages`

### Bash Version (Legacy)
- FMOS virtual appliance with admin user access
- `jq` installed (for JSON processing)
- `curl` installed (for API calls)
- Bash shell (standard on FMOS)
- FMOS Control Panel API credentials
- No root/sudo access required

## Installation

### Python Version (Recommended)

**On FireMon OS, install to `/var/lib/backup/firemon/` to avoid SELinux issues:**

```bash
# Download the Python script to the backup directory (avoids SELinux issues)
cd /var/lib/backup/firemon
wget -O manage_loadavg_check.py https://raw.githubusercontent.com/adamgunderson/FMOS-LoadAvgCheck-Manager/main/manage_loadavg_check.py

# Set proper permissions
chmod 755 manage_loadavg_check.py

# Verify installation (use python3.12 on FMOS)
python3.12 ./manage_loadavg_check.py status

# The status output will show if FireMon libraries were detected:
#   Platform: FireMon OS (detected)
#   FireMon packages: ‚úì Using 1 path(s)
#   requests module: ‚úì 2.27.1
```

**Important Notes:**
- **Installation Location**: Use `/var/lib/backup/firemon/` on FireMon OS - this directory has the proper SELinux context (`firemon_backup_t`) that allows root to execute scripts during post-backup operations.
- **On FireMon OS, you must use `python3.12`** (or the specific Python version installed). The default `python3` symlink may not have access to FireMon's pre-installed libraries.
- **Why not home directory?** SELinux in enforcing mode prevents root from executing scripts from user home directories (`user_home_t` context), causing "Permission denied" errors during post-backup execution.
- The script automatically detects and uses libraries from `/usr/lib/firemon/devpackfw/lib/python3.12/site-packages`.

### Bash Version

**On FireMon OS, install to `/var/lib/backup/firemon/` to avoid SELinux issues:**

```bash
# Download the bash script to the backup directory (avoids SELinux issues)
cd /var/lib/backup/firemon
wget -O manage_loadavg_check.sh https://raw.githubusercontent.com/adamgunderson/FMOS-LoadAvgCheck-Manager/main/manage_loadavg_check.sh

# Set proper permissions
chmod 755 manage_loadavg_check.sh

# Verify installation
bash ./manage_loadavg_check.sh status
```

**Important Notes:**
- **Installation Location**: Use `/var/lib/backup/firemon/` on FireMon OS - this directory has the proper SELinux context (`firemon_backup_t`) that allows root to execute scripts during post-backup operations.
- **Why not home directory?** SELinux in enforcing mode prevents root from executing scripts from user home directories (`user_home_t` context), causing "Permission denied" errors during post-backup execution.
- **Version stability**: Bash version doesn't depend on specific Python versions, making it more stable across FMOS upgrades.

### Manual Installation

#### Python Version
1. Copy `manage_loadavg_check.py` to your FMOS system
2. Save it to `/var/lib/backup/firemon/` directory (proper SELinux context for FMOS)
3. Set proper permissions:
   ```bash
   chmod 755 /var/lib/backup/firemon/manage_loadavg_check.py
   ```
4. Run it - the script will auto-detect FireMon's pre-installed libraries

#### Bash Version
1. Copy `manage_loadavg_check.sh` to your FMOS system
2. Save it to `/var/lib/backup/firemon/` directory (proper SELinux context for FMOS)
3. Set proper permissions:
   ```bash
   chmod 755 /var/lib/backup/firemon/manage_loadavg_check.sh
   ```
4. Run it - standard bash, no version dependencies

## Quick Start

### Python Version (Recommended)

```bash
# Navigate to the backup directory (proper SELinux context for FMOS)
cd /var/lib/backup/firemon

# Run the automatic setup (will prompt for API credentials)
# Use python3.12 on FireMon OS
python3.12 ./manage_loadavg_check.py setup

# You will be prompted for:
# - Username (defaults to your current user)
# - Password (hidden input)
# - Password confirmation

# Verify the configuration
python3.12 ./manage_loadavg_check.py status
```

### Bash Version

```bash
# Navigate to the backup directory (proper SELinux context for FMOS)
cd /var/lib/backup/firemon

# Run the automatic setup (will prompt for API credentials)
bash ./manage_loadavg_check.sh setup

# Verify the configuration
bash ./manage_loadavg_check.sh status
```

**What setup does:**
1. Prompt for and securely store FMOS Control Panel API credentials
2. Configure a cronjob to disable LoadAvgCheck 5 minutes before backup
3. Set up post-backup scripts to re-enable the check after backup completion
4. Show the current configuration status

**Note about SELinux (Bash version only):** If using the bash version and you encounter permission errors during post-backup execution, SELinux may be blocking cross-user script execution. See the [Troubleshooting](#post-backup-action-failures) section. **The Python version does not have this issue.**

## Usage

### Basic Commands

#### Python Version (Recommended)

```bash
# On FireMon OS, the script should be in /var/lib/backup/firemon/
# Use python3.12 on FireMon OS (or python3 on non-FMOS systems)

cd /var/lib/backup/firemon

# Show help and usage information
python3.12 ./manage_loadavg_check.py --help

# Manually disable the LoadAvgCheck
python3.12 ./manage_loadavg_check.py disable

# Manually enable the LoadAvgCheck (waits 15 minutes by default)
python3.12 ./manage_loadavg_check.py enable

# Enable LoadAvgCheck immediately without waiting
python3.12 ./manage_loadavg_check.py enable --no-wait

# Run full automatic setup
python3.12 ./manage_loadavg_check.py setup

# Remove all configurations and cleanup
python3.12 ./manage_loadavg_check.py cleanup

# Show current status and configuration
python3.12 ./manage_loadavg_check.py status

# Update stored API credentials
python3.12 ./manage_loadavg_check.py credentials
```

#### Bash Version

```bash
# On FireMon OS, the script should be in /var/lib/backup/firemon/
cd /var/lib/backup/firemon

# Show help and usage information
bash ./manage_loadavg_check.sh

# All the same commands work with bash script
bash ./manage_loadavg_check.sh disable
bash ./manage_loadavg_check.sh enable --no-wait
bash ./manage_loadavg_check.sh setup
bash ./manage_loadavg_check.sh status

# Additional bash-specific commands
bash ./manage_loadavg_check.sh logging on   # Toggle logging on
bash ./manage_loadavg_check.sh logging off  # Toggle logging off
```

### Credential Management

The script uses the FMOS Control Panel API and requires credentials:

```bash
# During setup, you'll be prompted for credentials
bash ~/manage_loadavg_check.sh setup

# To update credentials later
bash ~/manage_loadavg_check.sh credentials

# Credentials are stored in: ~/.fmos_api_creds (or script directory)
# File permissions: 644 (readable by all, writable by owner - allows root to read during post-backup)
# Storage: Base64 encoded (obfuscated, not encrypted)
```

**Alternative: Environment Variables**
```bash
# Set credentials via environment (takes priority over stored file)
export FMOS_API_USER=adam
export FMOS_API_PASS='your_password'

bash ~/manage_loadavg_check.sh enable
```

### Logging Options

Control logging behavior for debugging or production use:

```bash
# Run any command without logging (one-time)
bash ~/manage_loadavg_check.sh --no-log setup

# Use environment variable (alternative method)
NO_LOG=1 bash ~/manage_loadavg_check.sh disable

# Permanently disable logging for all automated runs
bash ~/manage_loadavg_check.sh logging off

# Re-enable logging
bash ~/manage_loadavg_check.sh logging on
```

### Wait Control Options

Control the 15-minute wait when re-enabling the health check:

```bash
# Enable with default 15 minute wait (recommended after backups)
bash ~/manage_loadavg_check.sh enable

# Enable immediately without waiting (use if manually re-enabling)
bash ~/manage_loadavg_check.sh enable --no-wait

# Use environment variable (alternative method)
NO_WAIT=1 bash ~/manage_loadavg_check.sh enable

# Combine flags
bash ~/manage_loadavg_check.sh enable --no-wait --no-log
```

**When to use `--no-wait`:**
- When manually re-enabling the check outside of backup operations
- When you know the system load has already settled
- When testing or troubleshooting the script

**When NOT to use `--no-wait`:**
- During the automated post-backup process (default behavior is correct)
- Immediately after a backup completes (let the 15-minute wait run)

## How It Works

### Backup Schedule Detection

The script automatically detects your FMOS backup schedule:
- Reads configuration from `fmos config get os/backup/auto-backup`
- Uses default time (23:48) if no custom schedule is configured
- Calculates pre-backup time (5 minutes before backup)

### Configuration Flow

1. **Setup Phase**
   - Prompts for API credentials (if not already stored)
   - Validates credentials against FMOS Control Panel API
   - Configures cronjob for pre-backup disable
   - Configures post-backup hook

2. **Pre-Backup (Cronjob)**
   - Runs 5 minutes before scheduled backup
   - Calls API to add `fmos.health.checks.basic.LoadAvgCheck` to ignore list
   - Applies configuration changes via API

3. **Post-Backup (Hook)**
   - Triggered automatically by FMOS after backup completion (runs as root)
   - Executes `/bin/bash /home/admin/manage_loadavg_check.sh enable`
   - Uses `/usr/bin/env` to set environment variables when logging control is needed
   - **Waits 15 minutes** for backup load average to settle before re-enabling
   - Script uses stored API credentials to authenticate
   - Calls API to remove LoadAvgCheck from ignore list
   - Runs on both backup success and failure

### File Locations

**Python Version (Recommended):**
- **Script**: `/var/lib/backup/firemon/manage_loadavg_check.py` (proper SELinux context)
- **Credentials**: `/home/<user>/.fmos_api_creds` (base64 encoded, 644 permissions)
- **Log File**: `/home/<user>/loadavg_check_manager.log` (located in user's home directory)
- **Cronjob**: User's crontab
- **FMOS Config** (via API):
  - `os/health` - Health check ignore list
  - `os/backup/post-backup` - Post-backup script hooks (executed by backup system as root)

**Bash Version:**
- **Script**: `/var/lib/backup/firemon/manage_loadavg_check.sh` (proper SELinux context)
- All other locations same as Python version

**Note**: The script runs directly from wherever you place it. Updates take effect immediately with no sync needed. On FMOS, `/var/lib/backup/firemon/` is required for **both Python and Bash versions** to work with SELinux.

## Status Output Example

```

```

## Troubleshooting

### Post-Backup Action Failures

#### Error: "No such file or directory: 'NO_LOG=0'"

If you see this error in backup logs, it means you have an older version of the script that doesn't use `/usr/bin/env` to set environment variables.

**The Fix:**
```bash
# Update to the latest version of the script
# Then re-run setup to update the post-backup configuration
bash /home/admin/manage_loadavg_check.sh setup
```

The latest version uses `/usr/bin/env` to properly set environment variables for the FMOS backup system.

#### Error: "/usr/bin/python3.12: can't open file '/home/firemon/manage_loadavg_check.py': [Errno 13] Permission denied"

This is the most common error with the Python version. The issue is **SELinux** - it prevents root from executing scripts in user home directories.

**The Root Cause:**
- SELinux is in **Enforcing** mode on FireMon OS
- Scripts in home directories have `user_home_t` SELinux context
- Root cannot execute files with this context during post-backup operations
- File permissions (755) are not enough when SELinux is enforcing

**The Fix - Move to Proper Location:**
```bash
# Move script to a location with proper SELinux context
cd /var/lib/backup/firemon
cp ~/manage_loadavg_check.py ./
chmod 755 ./manage_loadavg_check.py

# Re-run setup from the new location (IMPORTANT!)
python3.12 ./manage_loadavg_check.py setup

# This will reconfigure the post-backup hook to use the new path
# Test the backup
fmos backup
```

**Why `/var/lib/backup/firemon/` works:**
- Has `firemon_backup_t` SELinux context (not `user_home_t`)
- Root can execute scripts from this location
- Won't be cleaned up on reboot (unlike /tmp)
- Logically related to backup operations

After moving and re-running setup, the backup should succeed with: "‚úì Backup completed successfully"

**Alternative locations that work:**
- `/var/tmp/` - Has `tmp_t` context, but may be cleaned up
- `/opt/` - Requires root to write, but has `usr_t` context

#### Error: "/bin/bash: /home/admin/manage_loadavg_check.sh: Permission denied" (Bash version)

This error occurs when the bash script is in a home directory. The issue is **SELinux** - same as with the Python version.

**The Fix - Move to Proper Location:**
```bash
# Move script to a location with proper SELinux context
cd /var/lib/backup/firemon
cp ~/manage_loadavg_check.sh ./
chmod 755 ./manage_loadavg_check.sh

# Re-run setup from the new location (IMPORTANT!)
bash ./manage_loadavg_check.sh setup

# This will reconfigure the post-backup hook to use the new path
# Test the backup
fmos backup
```

**Why `/var/lib/backup/firemon/` works:**
- Has `firemon_backup_t` SELinux context (not `user_home_t`)
- Root can execute scripts from this location
- Same solution as Python version - both scripts have the same SELinux requirements

After moving and re-running setup, the backup should succeed.

#### Understanding SELinux on FireMon OS

FireMon OS runs SELinux in **Enforcing** mode. This is a security feature that prevents certain operations even with correct file permissions.

**Check SELinux status and context:**
```bash
# Check if SELinux is enforcing (it is on FMOS)
getenforce
# Output: Enforcing

# Check the SELinux context of your script
ls -Z ~/manage_loadavg_check.py
# Output: unconfined_u:object_r:user_home_t:s0  <- This is the problem!

# Check a working location
ls -Z /var/lib/backup/firemon/manage_loadavg_check.py
# Output: unconfined_u:object_r:firemon_backup_t:s0  <- This works!
```

**Why you can't use chcon or setenforce on FMOS:**
- FMOS is a virtual appliance with restricted admin access
- No `sudo` or root access available to regular users
- Cannot modify SELinux policies or change contexts
- Cannot set SELinux to permissive mode

**The only solution:** Install the script in `/var/lib/backup/firemon/` which has the correct SELinux context by default.

#### Error: "Post-backup action failed" (Permission Denied - API Related)

If you see "Post-backup action failed" errors related to permissions:

**The Solution:**
The script now uses the FMOS Control Panel API instead of CLI commands, which completely eliminates permission issues!

**Verify Configuration:**
```bash
# Check that credentials are stored
bash /home/admin/manage_loadavg_check.sh status
# Should show: "Stored credentials: ‚úì (user: adam)"

# Verify credentials file permissions (should be 644)
ls -la ~/.fmos_api_creds

# Test API authentication manually
bash /home/admin/manage_loadavg_check.sh enable --no-wait
bash /home/admin/manage_loadavg_check.sh disable

# Check post-backup configuration via API
curl -k -s \
  -H "Cookie: $(cat ~/.fmos_api_creds | head -1 | base64 -d)" \
  "https://localhost:55555/api/config/values/os%2Fbackup%2Fpost-backup"
```

**Update Credentials:**
```bash
# If credentials are wrong or expired
bash /home/admin/manage_loadavg_check.sh credentials

# Re-run setup to update both credentials and post-backup config
bash /home/admin/manage_loadavg_check.sh setup
```

### Permission Denied Error (Direct Execution)

If you encounter "Permission denied" when executing the script directly:

```bash
# FMOS may have noexec on home directory, use bash explicitly
bash ~/manage_loadavg_check.sh setup

# Create an alias for convenience
echo "alias manage_loadavg='bash ~/manage_loadavg_check.sh'" >> ~/.bashrc
source ~/.bashrc
manage_loadavg status
```


### Automatic Cronjob Synchronization

The script automatically detects when the backup schedule has changed and updates the cronjob accordingly:

```bash
# The cronjob is automatically checked and updated during:
# - enable operations (post-backup)
# - disable operations (pre-backup via cron)
# - status checks (displays warning if out of sync)

# Example: You change backup from 23:48 to 02:00
# Next time the script runs (enable/disable), you'll see:
‚ö† Backup schedule has changed!
  Backup is now at: 02:00
  Cronjob updated to: 01:55

# Or when running status:
Cronjob Status:
  43 23 * * * /bin/bash /home/admin/manage_loadavg_check.sh disable >/dev/null 2>&1

  ‚ö† WARNING: Cronjob schedule is out of sync!
  Current cronjob: 23:43
  Should be:       01:55 (5 min before backup at 02:00)
  Run 'bash /home/admin/manage_loadavg_check.sh enable' or 'disable' to auto-update
```

**How it works:**
1. Every time `enable` or `disable` runs, it queries the current backup schedule via API
2. Compares it with the current cronjob schedule
3. If different, automatically updates the cronjob to run 5 minutes before the new backup time
4. Logs the change and notifies you

This means you can change the backup schedule in the FMOS UI and the script will automatically adapt!

### Verify Check is Being Disabled

```bash
# Check current ignore list via API
curl -k -s -H "Cookie: ..." "https://localhost:55555/api/config/values/os%2Fhealth" | jq '.health.ignore_checks'

# Monitor the log file (if logging enabled)
tail -f ~/loadavg_check_manager.log
```

### Manual Recovery

If automatic re-enable fails:

```bash
# Manually re-enable the check (waits 15 minutes)
bash ~/manage_loadavg_check.sh enable

# Or re-enable immediately without waiting
bash ~/manage_loadavg_check.sh enable --no-wait

# Verify it's enabled
bash ~/manage_loadavg_check.sh status
```

### Complete Removal

To completely remove all configurations:

```bash
# Remove all setup and re-enable checks
# This removes:
#   - Pre-backup cronjob
#   - Post-backup hook configuration
#   - Stored API credentials
#   - Re-enables LoadAvgCheck
bash ~/manage_loadavg_check.sh cleanup

# Optionally remove the script and logs
rm -f ~/manage_loadavg_check.sh
rm -f ~/loadavg_check_manager.log
rm -f ~/.fmos_api_creds
```

## Security Considerations

- Designed for FMOS virtual appliance (no root/sudo access required)
- Script uses explicit `/bin/bash` interpreter to work when executed by backup system (root)
- **Script permissions**: Script file must be 755 (rwxr-xr-x) to allow root to read/execute during post-backup
- **SELinux considerations**: If SELinux is enforcing, the script may need proper security contexts (see Troubleshooting)
- **API-based authentication**: Uses FMOS Control Panel API instead of CLI commands
- **Credential storage**: Base64 encoded in `.fmos_api_creds` with 644 permissions (readable by all, writable by owner only)
- **Portable design**: Dynamically detects admin username - no hardcoded values
- All operations use FMOS Control Panel API (`https://localhost:55555/api`)
- All operations logged for audit purposes (when logging enabled)
- No direct system file modifications - all changes via API
- Cronjob runs with admin user privileges
- **Simple architecture**: Script runs from wherever placed - no temporary copies needed
